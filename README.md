# What are design patterns ?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems in software development. 
They provide a way to describe a design problem, its solution, and the consequences of the solution in a way that can be easily communicated to others. 
Design patterns are important because they provide a common language for developers to communicate with each other and a way to document and reuse successful design solutions.

It is important to note that patterns are not algorithms or specific implementations. 
They are more like ideas, opinions, and abstractions that can be useful in certain situations to solve a particular kind of problem.

Using design patterns help make code more maintainable and flexible by promoting the use of proven design practices. 
This can save time and effort for developers, as they can reuse existing solutions rather than having to come up with new ones for each problem they encounter.

Design patterns are divided into several categories, including **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** patterns. 

- Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. 
- Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.
- Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together.

Over the past few years, web-development ecosystem has undergone rapid changes with exponential rise in codebase. 
Being aware of the patterns helps developers write high quality code but also come up with enhanced versions of those patterns to solve modern problems with the latest technologies.

Some of the benefits we get from implementing design patterns in our code are: 

- **Proven solutions:** Because design patterns are often used by many developers, you can be certain that they work. And not only that, you can be certain that they were revised multiple times and optimizations were probably implemented.
- **Easily reusable:** Design patterns document a reusable solution which can be modified to solve multiple particular problems, as they are not tied to a specific problem.
- **Expressive:** Design patterns can explain a large solution quite elegantly.
- **Ease of communication:** When developers are familiar with design patterns, they can more easily communicate with one another about potential solutions to a given problem.
- **Prevent the need for refactoring code:** If an application is written with design patterns in mind, it is often the case that you wonâ€™t need to refactor the code later on because applying the correct design pattern to a given problem is already an optimal solution.
- **Lower the size of the codebase:** Because design patterns are usually elegant and optimal solutions, they usually require less code than other solutions.
